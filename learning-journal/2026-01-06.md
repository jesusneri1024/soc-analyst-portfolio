## Key Concepts Learned

In contrast with windows, on Linux it is very ussual to use the terminal to create/modifid files or directories.

To create a directorie we type the command [mkdir] and to make a file we type the command [touch].

We can modify a file with nano, use the command [nano] and the direction of the file, ex. _nano /etc/example.txt_.

There's the command [find] that helps us find something specific, for example, [find / -type f -name *.bak | wc -l], what that does is find all the files that are .bak in the sysyem, then the wc -l gives us the number of the files.

## Hands-On Practice

- Find specific files across the system.

## Interesting Observation

## SOC Perspective
