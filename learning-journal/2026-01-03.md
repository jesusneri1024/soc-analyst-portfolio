## Module

- Network Foundations (Hack The Box Academy)

## Topics Covered

- How a client connects to the internet
- IP address assignment when connecting to a modem/router
- DNS resolution process
- Basic firewall concepts
- Linux commands to inspect network connections
- Localhost (127.0.0.1)

## Key Concepts Learned

The most important concept today was understanding what actually happens when I access a website.

From a client perspective, the process starts when my computer connects to the network and receives an IP address.
When I type a domain name like `google.com`, DNS is used to resolve the domain into an IP address.
Once the IP is known, the request can be routed to the correct server, and the response is sent back specifically to my machine.

I also learned how firewalls control and filter traffic, and how they play a key role in allowing or blocking connections.

## Hands-On Practice

- Used basic Linux networking commands to inspect active connections and interfaces
- Checked which services and ports were in use
- Identified local network behavior versus external connections

## Interesting Observation

One concept I found particularly interesting was `127.0.0.1` (localhost).
It helped me understand how a system can communicate with itself without leaving the machine, which is useful for testing services and understanding internal traffic.

## SOC Perspective

Understanding how normal network communication works is essential for detecting abnormal behavior.
Knowing how DNS, IP addressing, and traffic flow operate helps identify suspicious connections, misconfigurations, or malicious activity in a SOC environment.
