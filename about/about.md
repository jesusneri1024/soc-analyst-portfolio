# About Me

My name is **Jesús Ángel Neri Hernández**.  
I am an **Entry-Level Cybersecurity Analyst** and final-semester student at **Universidad Iberoamericana León**, majoring in **Interactive Digital Design**.

Although my degree is not strictly cybersecurity-focused, my background is deeply technical. I have worked as a developer in multiple environments, from **Linux servers and cloud deployments** to **game engines and backend systems**.

My goal is to transition fully into **defensive security and SOC operations**.

## Why Cybersecurity & SOC

My interest in cybersecurity comes from understanding how **critical modern infrastructure depends on secure systems**.

Banks, companies, and essential services rely on technology that must be protected 24/7.  
SOC work resonates with me because it combines:

- Technical investigation
- Real-time decision making
- Clear procedures
- Documentation and reporting

I enjoy breaking down complex problems and understanding them in the **most practical way possible**.

---

## Current Focus

I am currently training through the **SOC Analyst Path at Hack The Box Academy**.

My routine:

- ~**1.5 hours of daily study**
- **5 days per week**
- Continuous documentation of:
  - What I learn
  - What I understand
  - What still confuses me

This portfolio documents that journey.

## What I Am Looking For

An **Entry-Level SOC Analyst (L1)** position (preferably remote) where I can:

- Apply defensive security fundamentals
- Learn from real incidents
- Grow into advanced blue-team roles

---

## Learning Philosophy

I believe learning should be:

- Practical
- Documented
- Incremental

I do not claim to be an expert.  
I aim to show **how I think, learn, and improve**.
