# About Me

My name is **Jesús Ángel Neri Hernández**.  
I am an **Entry-Level Cybersecurity Analyst** and final-semester student at **Universidad Iberoamericana León**, majoring in **Interactive Digital Design**.

Although my degree is not strictly cybersecurity-focused, my background is deeply technical. I have worked as a developer in multiple environments, from **Linux servers and cloud deployments** to **game engines and backend systems**.

My goal is to transition fully into **defensive security and SOC operations**.

## Why Cybersecurity & SOC

My interest in cybersecurity comes from understanding how **critical modern infrastructure depends on secure systems**.

Banks, companies, and essential services rely on technology that must be protected 24/7.  
SOC work resonates with me because it combines:

- Technical investigation
- Real-time decision making
- Clear procedures
- Documentation and reporting

I enjoy breaking down complex problems and understanding them in the **most practical way possible**.

---

## Current Focus

I am currently training through the **SOC Analyst Path at Hack The Box Academy**.

My routine:

- ~**1.5 hours of daily study**
- **5 days per week**
- Continuous documentation of:
  - What I learn
  - What I understand
  - What still confuses me

This portfolio documents that journey.
