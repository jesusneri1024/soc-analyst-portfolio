# About Me

My name is **Jesus Neri**. I am a final-semester student at **Universidad Iberoamericana León**, majoring in **Interactive Digital Design**.

While my academic background is not directly focused on cybersecurity, my interest in computing has always been broad. I enjoy understanding how systems work, from low-level concepts like hardware to higher-level systems such as software platforms and video games.

## Why Cybersecurity and SOC

My interest in cybersecurity comes from realizing how much **modern life depends on secure computer systems**.

Financial systems, companies, and critical services rely on secure infrastructure. A failure in security can have real-world consequences, which is why defensive security and SOC work feel meaningful to me.

I am especially interested in SOC roles because they combine:

- Technical analysis
- Real-time problem solving
- Clear processes
- Structured documentation

I enjoy breaking down complex problems and understanding them in the **simplest and most practical way possible**.

## Current Focus

I am currently training through the **SOC Analyst Path at Hack The Box Academy**.

My current routine:

- Study and practice around **1.5 hours per day**
- Train **5 days per week**
- Document what I learn, what I understand, and what still feels unclear

This portfolio exists to honestly reflect that process.

## Technical Background

### Professional Experience (Non-Security)

**Unity 3D Developer – Gato Lobo**  
León, GTO | June 2025 – November 2025

- Unity developer for the narrative-driven game _Peach Hills Division_, published on Steam and Patreon
- Worked in a small development team using **C#**
- Implemented gameplay systems, UI, event handling, localization, and internal tools
- Debugged, refactored, and improved existing code
- Collaborated with artists and designers using **Git** for version control

This experience helped me develop:

- Strong debugging skills
- Logical and structured thinking
- Comfort working with complex systems
- Clear technical communication

## What I Am Looking For

I am looking for an **entry-level SOC Analyst (L1)** position, ideally **remote**, where I can:

- Apply defensive security fundamentals
- Learn from real-world security events
- Grow into more advanced blue team roles over time

---

## Learning Philosophy

I believe learning works best when it is:

- Practical
- Documented
- Incremental

I do not aim to present myself as an expert.  
I aim to show **how I think, how I learn, and how I improve**.

## Outside of Technology

Outside of technology, I train consistently in **strength training, boxing, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu**.

These disciplines reinforce values I apply to cybersecurity and learning:
discipline, consistency, and staying calm under pressure.
